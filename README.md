# stress-app-detection

- Won 2 awards out of 1,700 students sponsored by Arduino and Otsuka Pharmaceutical
- Collaborated with a team of 4 and created LavÜ, a wearable electromyogram (EMG) sensor that monitors muscle tension/ haptic feedback
- Created the LavÜ App that displays a chart of your stress levels throughout the day and provides exercises to reduce stress levels

# Stress Levels ML
We also did some data analysis in python displaying peoples stress detection using SaYoPillow.csv file. We used supervised learning because we label and pre-process the input data before we run the algorithm. We used a Linear Regression machine Learning model where the model finds the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variables.
